# Level 1 - Write Code

## Resources

### Java Learning Resources

#### Archaic

* [Java Tutorials](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/)
* [Java for Complete Beginners](https://www.udemy.com/java-tutorial/)
* [Java Programming and Software Engineering Fundamentals](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/java-programming)

#### Curated Learning

* [CSAwesome, Code.org Curated Courses](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1G6nhE6ZZyG30miTqGP7l75sut6OiOxBa-8xqMm8F-_E)

### WPI Programming Introduction

* [WPILib Documentation](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/zero-to-robot/introduction.html)

## Deliverable

* [Practice Robot Template](https://github.com/FRCTeam4500/PracticeRobotChallengeTemplate)

Clone the Github repository above and open it in VSCode. 

In the `src/main/java/frc/robot/subsystems/` directory, open `TankDriveSubsystem.java`.

Inside is a `TankDriveSubsystem` class and constructor.

Use the resources provided to create the attributes and methods necessary for making a subsystem.

    [Build Night #1](/Programming Prophecy/Reflections/Build Night 9.28)

    Looking over the flywheel code will be more helpful than looking at the arm code, since the flywheel uses percent output

Then, in the `src/main/java/frc/robot/commands/` directory, open `TankDriveCommand.java`.

Inside is, once again, a constructor. Fill in the excecute method like the comments say and add [authored documentation](../Programming%20Prophecy/Best%20Practices/AuthoredDocs.md) to everything (All classes and methods with detailed explanations). 

Once finished, bring to one of the leads, and we will get it to a coach. Once approved, you will recieve Level 1 in programming.
