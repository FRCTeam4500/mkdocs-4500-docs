## Classes
A class is a template for an object, and they are the main building blocks of a java program. Each class contains a constructor to create an object and methods to define what that object can do. They also contain attributes, or variables, which allow them to hold information about themselves.

### Class Attributes
A class' attributes represent information that an object of that class would hold. These attributes can be primatives, like doubles or booleans, or they can be objects of other classes. 

### Class Methods
A class' methods represent actions that an object of that class could take. These methods can carry out tasks or return information. 

### Class Constructor
A class' constructor is a special method that is called when an object is first created. It has a return type of the class it belongs to, and is used for initializing values and performing tasks
